# Titanic

Preprocess the data (e.g. cleaning, dealing with missing data, transformation of categorical variables). Built classification models in Python to predict the “Survived” binary status assigned to a passenger. Used logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), decision trees, AdaBoost, random forest, and cross validation.
